## Challenge  
Create a solution that empowers people living with disabilities by making education more accessible.

## Solution  
**SignBonga** is a digital platform designed to teach **Kenyan Sign Language** (KSL) in an easy, interactive, and convenient way. By leveraging **Machine Learning** and **human tutors**, SignBonga helps break communication barriers, reducing the stigma faced by the deaf community. It empowers more people to learn sign language, creating a more inclusive environment where the deaf have more people to engage with, which directly impacts their social interaction and mental well-being.

## Target Market  
- **Parents** of children who are deaf or mute.  
- **Individuals** who lose the ability to hear or speak due to illness or injury.  
- **Curious learners** interested in learning a new language or enhancing their communication skills.  
- **Professionals** and individuals who wish to better interact with the deaf community, such as educators, healthcare workers, and public service providers.

## Importance  
SignBonga fosters social inclusion and communication by encouraging more people to learn Kenyan Sign Language. By equipping users with essential sign language skills, the app reduces the stigma often experienced by the deaf and mute population, improving their sense of belonging and mental health. This wider knowledge base creates a society where deaf individuals have more people to communicate with, significantly enhancing their quality of life.

## Impact  
SignBonga's accessible, user-friendly approach promotes better communication, reduces isolation, and improves mental health for deaf individuals. By bridging the communication gap, it supports the deaf community’s social, emotional, and economic inclusion. SignBonga aims to cultivate a society where everyone has the tools to communicate effectively, regardless of physical limitations.
